# REACT NATIVE NEWS APP
### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In this project I developed a new Mobile Application with React Native. The UI is very simple as you can see in the below screenshot. There is multiple categories that the user can choose from like business, sports, technology etc...

### INSHORT API
I used [Unofficial InShorts News API](https://github.com/cyberboysumanjay/Inshorts-News-API) for collecting news information.
